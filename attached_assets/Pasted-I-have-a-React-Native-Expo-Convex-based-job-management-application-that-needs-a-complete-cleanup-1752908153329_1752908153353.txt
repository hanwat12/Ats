I have a React Native + Expo + Convex-based job management application that needs a complete cleanup, simplification, and fix. The goal is to retain only the essential, working features and delete everything else — including unused frontend screens, routes, backend logic, extra database tables, authentication flows, and irrelevant code. The features that must be preserved and work flawlessly include: (1) Admin Signup & Login with secure token/session-based authentication and redirection to the admin dashboard; (2) Admin Job Posting, where the Admin can create job posts (title, role, location, description), and these are stored in the Convex database and made visible to HRs; (3) HR Signup & Login with secure auth and redirection to the HR dashboard; (4) HR Dashboard to View Jobs, showing a list of all jobs posted by the Admin with details like title, role, and posted date; (5) Candidate Upload by HR, allowing the HR to select a job and submit a candidate’s details (name, email, experience) along with a resume (PDF or DOC), which must upload without error and store properly in the Convex database; (6) Admin View of Uploaded Candidates, filtered by job, with access to full candidate details and resumes; (7) Candidate Shortlisting by Admin, with shortlisted status updated in the database and made visible to HRs; (8) Shortlisted Candidate Confirmation by HR, where HR sees only shortlisted candidates and can confirm them with updates stored in the database; (9) a Query Messaging System, where HR can send job or candidate-related queries to Admin, and Admin can respond — all messages should be stored in Convex DB as threaded conversations; (10) a Notification System that alerts Admin or HR when resumes are uploaded, candidates are shortlisted or confirmed, or queries are sent or responded to, with notifications stored per user and displayed in their dashboard; and finally, (11) a Feedback Section, which must not be removed — this feature allows either Admin or HR to submit feedback about the app or process, with fields including Name, Role, and Message. Feedback should be stored in the Convex database, and a simple page or modal must allow Admin (or both roles) to view submitted feedback. All other unused functionality, such as Candidate login/signup, interview or requisition logic, extra database tables, unrelated auth or Redux logic, and test/development files should be permanently removed. The final app must be clean, minimal, functional on both Android and Web, with working screen navigation, working backend connections, and all defined features free of warnings or bugs (e.g., suppressing shadow or resizeMode warnings where possible). Only the Admin and HR roles should exist in the app and database.
